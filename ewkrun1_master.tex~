\subsection{What you will need to supply}
Submissions to our journals are handled via the ScholarOne web-based submission system.  When you submit
a new article to us you need only submit a PDF of your article.  When you submit a revised version,
we ask you to submit the source files as well.  Upon acceptance for publication we will use the source files to produce a proof of your article in the journal style. 

\subsubsection{Text.}When you send us the source files for a revised version of your submission,
you should send us the \LaTeX\ source code of your paper with all figures read in by 
the source code (see section \ref{figinc}).
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Using \LaTeX\ packages.} Most \LaTeXe\ packages can be used if they are 
available in common distributions of \LaTeXe; however, if it is essential to use 
a non-standard package then any extra files needed to process the article must 
also be supplied.  Try to avoid using any packages that manipulate or change the standard
\LaTeX\ fonts: published articles use fonts in the Times family, but we prefer that you 
use \LaTeX\ default Computer Modern fonts in your submission.  The use of \LaTeX\ 2.09, and of plain
\TeX\ and variants such as AMSTeX is acceptable, but a complete PDF of your submission should be supplied in these cases.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Figures.} Figures should ideally be included in an article as encapsulated PostScript files
(see section \ref{figinc}) or created using standard \LaTeX\ drawing commands. 
 Please name all figure files using the guidelines in section \ref{fname}.
We accept submissions that use pdf\TeX\ to include
PDF or bitmap figures, but please ensure that you send us a PDF that uses PDF version 1.4 or lower
(to avoid problems in the ScholarOne system).
You can do this by putting \verb"\pdfminorversion=4" at the very start of your TeX file.

\label{fig1}All figures should be included within the body of the text 
at an appropriate point or grouped together with their captions at the end of the article. A standard graphics inclusion package such as \verb"graphicx" should be used for figure inclusion, and the package should be declared in the usual
way, for example with \verb"\usepackage{graphicx}", after the \verb"\documentclass" command.
Authors should avoid using special effects generated by including verbatim
PostScript code in the submitted \LaTeX\ file. Wherever possible, please try to use standard \LaTeX\ tools 
and packages.

\subsubsection{References.\label{bibby}}
You can produce your bibliography in the standard \LaTeX\ way using the \verb"\bibitem" command. Alternatively
you can use BibTeX: our preferred  \verb".bst" styles are: 

\subsection{Acknowledgments}
Authors wishing to acknowledge assistance or encouragement from 
colleagues, special work by technical staff or financial support from 
organizations should do so in an unnumbered `Acknowledgments' section 
immediately following the last numbered section of the paper. In \verb"iopart.cls" the 
command \verb"\ack" sets the acknowledgments heading as an unnumbered
section.

Please ensure that you include all of the sources of funding and the funding contract reference numbers that you are contractually obliged to acknowledge. We often receive requests to add such information very late in the production process, or even after the article is published, and we cannot always do this. Please collect all of the necessary information from your co-authors and sponsors as early as possible.
