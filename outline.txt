Abstract:
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has completed in 2012 it's first running 
phase and the experiments have collected data sets of pp collisions at centre-of-mass
energies of 7 and 8 TeV with an integrated luminosity of about 5ifb and 20ifb, respectively.
Analyses of these data sets have produced a rich set of results in the electroweak sector 
of the standard model. This article reviews the status of electroweak measurements of 
the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC and discusses phenomenological developments 
in the electroweak sector.
